## About me
I’m twenty-nine old. In my past life I worked as a videographer. When I was a child, filming was my hobby, which became a profession. But I also like computers and everything related to them. For years I have dreamed of becoming a web developer but I didn't have enough time to study. Now I am completely free and ready to absorb knowledge like a sponge. I believe that I can achieve my dream and become a web developer.
